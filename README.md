# 🤝 Thinking Machines Intro Package  
**Bridging AGI & Human Cognition via the Jocker Protocol**  
*(An open invitation to collaborate with Mira Murati and Thinking Machines Lab)*

## 📜 **Intro Letter to Dr. Murati**  
```text  
Dear Dr. Murati,  

Your vision at OpenAI and Thinking Machines Lab — particularly the  
interdisciplinary approach to AGI — aligns perfectly with our work on the  
*Jocker Protocol*. We’ve built a decentralized framework for:  

- **Thought2Thought Matching** (cognitive hashing)  
- **Temporal Reasoning** (Moments Protocol extension)  
- **Ethical AI Incentives** (Albanian-backed Web3 model)  

As fellow builders in the small-nation AI space (🇦🇱), we’d value your  
perspective on merging our protocols with Thinking Machines’ AGI stack.  

Explore the proof-of-concept below, and let’s discuss how to scale this  
for global impact.  

Sincerely,  
[Mansour Adam]  
Founder, Jocker Protocol
