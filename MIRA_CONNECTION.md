# Open Collaboration Request to Mira Murati

**Dear Dr. Murati,**  

Your work at OpenAI and Thinking Machines Lab demonstrates the exact *interdisciplinary bridge* our **Jocker Protocol** seeks to formalize:  

- Our **cognitive hashing** system extends your vision of "AI as human capability amplifiers"  
- We've built what you described in 2024: *"A Wikipedia for reasoning patterns"*  
- Albanian-backed project (Proud to connect with your roots!)  

**Request:** Let's discuss merging:  
ðŸ”¹ *Thinking Machines' AGI frameworks*  
ðŸ”¹ *Our decentralized thought-matching layer*
